This is a second generation model of the 747-8.  The first generation of the
747-8 Intercontinental by Grupo FGBr was based on the 747-400 model by Gijs
de Rooy.  This version is derived from the FGBr version with modifications to
the 3D models and FDM, and the addition of many systems.

Original cockpit model, landing gear, and many textures used in both the 
Intercontinental (passenger) version and the Freigher come from the 747-400
model by Gijs de Rooy (with the help of Ivan Ngeow, Jentron, Syd Adams,
Torsten Dreyer, Markus Bulik).

Wings, engines, original -8i fuselage model and FDM, and additional textures
by Grupo FGBr (Aurino das Neves, Isaias Prestes, Rick Britto, Wagner Silva).

With the exception of the wings, engines, and horizontal and vertical stabiliz-
ers, all the models and systems have been modified from the original versions
by John Williams.
